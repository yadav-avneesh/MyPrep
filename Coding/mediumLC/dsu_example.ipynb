    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "As new students begin to arrive at college, each receives a unique ID number, 1 to n. Initially, the students do not know one another, and each has a different circle of friends. As the semester \n",
    "progresses, other groups of friends begin to form randomly. \n",
    "There will be three arrays, each aligned by an index. The first array will contain a queryType which will be either Friend or Total. The next two arrays, students1 and students2, will each \n",
    "contain a student ID. If the query type is Friend, the two students become friends. If the query type is Total, report the sum of the sizes of each group of friends for the two students.\n",
