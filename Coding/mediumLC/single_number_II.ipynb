    "encoding, uniquely decodable codes, prefix rules, and Huffman Tree construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "We already know that every character is sequences of 0's and 1's and stored using 8-bits. \n",
    "This is known as “fixed-length encoding”, as each character uses the same number of fixed-bit \n",

    "\n",
    "Given a text, how to reduce the amount of space required to store a character?\n",
    "The idea is to use “variable-length encoding”. We can exploit the fact that some characters occur \n",
    "more frequently than others in a text (refer to this) to design an algorithm that can represent \n",
    "the same piece of text using a lesser number of bits. In variable-length encoding, we assign a \n",
    "variable number of bits to characters depending upon their frequency in the given text. So, some \n",
    "characters might end up taking a single bit, and some might end up taking two bits, some might be\n",
    "encoded using three bits, and so on. The problem with variable-length encoding lies in its decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of bits, how to decode it uniquely?\n",
    "Let's consider the string aabacdab. It has 8 characters in it and uses 64-bits storage \n",
    "(using fixed-length encoding). If we note, the frequency of characters a, b, c and d are 4, 2, 1, 1,\n",
    " respectively. Let's try to represent aabacdab using a lesser number of bits by using the fact that a \n",
    " occurs more frequently than b, and b occurs more frequently than c and d. We start by randomly \n",
    " assigning a single bit code 0 to a, 2-bit code 11 to b, and 3-bit code 100 and 011 to characters c \n",
    " and d, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "a 0\n",
    "b 11\n",
    "c 100\n",
    "d 011\n",
    "So, the string aabacdab will be encoded to 00110100011011 (0|0|11|0|100|011|0|11) using the above codes. \n",
    "But the real problem lies in decoding. If we try to decode the string 00110100011011, it will lead to \n",
    "ambiguity as it can be decoded to,\n",
    "\n",

    "…\n",
    "and so on\n",
    "To prevent ambiguities in decoding, we will ensure that our encoding satisfies the “prefix rule”, \n",
    "which will result in “uniquely decodable codes”. The prefix rule states that no code is a prefix of \n",
    "another code. By code, we mean the bits used for a particular character. In the above example, 0 is \n",
    "the prefix of 011, which violates the prefix rule. If our codes satisfy the prefix rule, the decoding\n",
    " will be unambiguous (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the above example again. This time we assign codes that satisfy the prefix rule to \n",
