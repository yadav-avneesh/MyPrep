    "* Step 1 : How to classify a problem as a Dynamic Programming Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Typically, all the problems that require to maximize or minimize certain quantity or counting problems that say to count the arrangements under certain condition or certain probability problems can be solved by using Dynamic Programming. All dynamic programming problems satisfy the overlapping subproblems property and most of the classic dynamic problems also satisfy the optimal substructure property. Once, we observe these properties in a given problem, be sure that it can be solved using DP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2 : Deciding the state\n",
    "    * DP problems are all about state and their transition. This is the most basic step which must be done very carefully because the state transition depends on the choice of state definition you make. So, let’s see what do we mean by the term “state”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * State A state can be defined as the set of parameters that can uniquely identify a certain position or standing in the given problem. This set of parameters should be as small as possible to reduce state space. For example: \n",
    "        * In our famous Knapsack problem, we define our state by two parameters index and weight i.e DP[index][weight]. Here DP[index][weight] tells us the maximum profit it can make by taking items from range 0 to index having the capacity of sack to be weight. Therefore, here the parameters index and weight together can uniquely identify a subproblem for the knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * So, our first step will be deciding a state for the problem after identifying that the problem is a DP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * As we know DP is all about using calculated results to formulate the final result. So, our next step will be to find a relation between previous states to reach the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3 : Formulating a relation among the states\n",
    "    * This part is the hardest part of for solving a DP problem and requires a lot of intuition, observation and practice. Let’s understand it by considering a sample problem\n",
