    "\n",
    "* Leonard Euler\n",
    "* Seven bridges of Konigsberg --- can we go through each bridge without repeating?\n",
    "* He devised the graph concepts to solve this problem\n",
    "* Vertices and Edges\n",
    "* In any graph we can do eulerian walk if there are atmost 0 or 2 vertices with odd degree, and those should be start \n",
    "  or end vertex, every other vertex should have even degree. Implying that from any intermediate vertext we should\n",
    "  be able to enter and exit only if its degreee is even.\n",
    "* We learned the def : G = (V, E), |V| = order of graph, |E| = size of graph; Graph is an ordered pair of (V, E) where V is a finite set of elements and E is a set of 2-subsets of V.\n",
    "* E = uv or {u, v} same, undirectional edge with end vertices as u, v. (u, v) --> Directed edge, start at u and end at v.\n",
    "* Simple graph : No loop, no multi edge.\n",
    "* Directd graph : Edge is directed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Graphs\n",
    "* G = (V(G), E(G))\n",
    "* E = uv, mean u and v are adjacent. E1 and E2 have common vertex then E1 and E2 are adjacent.\n",
    "* Disconneted graph.\n",
    "* Complete graph: K<sub>n</sub>, is a complete graph of n vertices. Where all vertices are connected to each other, hence |E| = <sup>N</sup>C<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "* Empty graph : No edges.\n",
    "* Bipartitite graph : Divided into two group of vertices such that within a group no two vertices are connected. A complete Bipartite graph thus is denoted by K<sub>n, m</sub>\n",
    "  * K<sub>1, m</sub> : Star graph, because one set has only one vertex.\n",
    "* Path : P<sub>n</sub> : vertices arranged in a sequence, (|E| = |V| - 1), no vertices repeated;\n",
    "* Cycle : C<sub>n</sub> :  vertices arranged in cyclic sequence, same as path but start and end vertex are same. (|E| = |V|), |V| >= 3.\n",
    "* Traingle graph = C<sub>3</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connected and Regular graphs;\n",
    "* Connected G : if for every pair of vertices, there exist a path from one to the other. Else it'll be disconneted.\n",
    "* Regular G\n",
    "  * Neighborhood: Open and Close; \n",
    "    * Open: N<sub>G</sub>(a) = {vertices adjacent to a}\n",
    "    * Close:  N<sub>G</sub>\\[a\\] = {vertices adjacent to a} + {a}\n",
    "  * Degree of a vertex = number of edges incident on vertext = |N<sub>G</sub>(a)|\n",
    "  * R regular, if degree of every vertext is R.\n",

    "    * 1-regular = Disjoint union of K<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "    * 2-regular = Disjoin union of cycles of any length\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sum of degrees\n",
    "* Always twice the number of edges !\n",
    "* sum(deg(v)) = 2 * |E|\n",
    "* Every single edge counted twice.\n",
    "* In any graph there are even number of odd degree vertices.\n",
    "  * Graph with 10 2-degree and 1 3-degree : Impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjacency matrix and incidence matrix\n",
    "* Adjacency\n",
    "  * A = |V| * |V| matrix, A\\[i\\]\\[j\\] = {1 (adjacent), 0(not adajcent)} \n",
    "  * Row and column are vertices\n",

    "  * Row sum = degree of V represented by Row\n",
    "  * Col sum = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic problems\n",
    "* Prove for a simple graph, number of edges is <= <sup>N</sup>C<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "* Prove that every Path ( P<sub>n</sub>) is bipartite?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph isomorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two simple graphs (G and H) are isomorphic, if there is a bijection which preserves adjacency and nonadjacency \n",
    "  * $\\theta$  :V(G) -> V(H)\n",
    "  * $uv \\in E(G)$ <=> $\\theta(u) \\theta(v) \\in E(H)$\n",
    "* Then $G \\sim= H$ \n",
    "* A bijection is a map from a set A to a set B that is 1-to-1(inective) and onto(surjective); that is for every element in set A there is an element y in set B\n",
    "  * $x \\in A$ $\\exists$ $y \\in B$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isomorphic or not?\n",
    "* |V| and |E| must be same.\n",
    "* Physical structure\n",
    "  * degree of vertices \n",
    "  * bipartite?\n",
    "* Now look for bijection\n",
    "* Not isomorphic --- find strucutral dissimilarity\n",
    "  * find non adjacent vertices and compare\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Degree and Neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neighbors = incident = degree\n",
    "* Min degree, Max degree of a graph is min and max of all degrees in a Graph.\n",
    "* Bipartite test with coloring \n",
    "  * Color any vertex with C1, and its nbs with C2\n",
    "  * Proceed by coloring all nbs or already colored vertex with opposite color.\n",
    "  * If bipartite then we'll be able to color all with no contradiction -> 2 color graph that covers all vertices.\n",
    "  * Problem would occur --> If there is a cycle of odd number.\n",
    "  * $C_{n}$ would be bipartite <=> n is even else it'll not be bipartite as we'll not have a 2-color graph out of this one because if n is odd then nbs would also be adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spanning and induced sub graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sub graph\n",
    "  * Through vertex deletion : $G - V_{1}$, remove all edges associate with v1 too :: Vertex deleted sub-graph\n",
    "  * Through edge deletion : G\\e1, only edge deleted :: Edge deleted sub graph\n",
    "  * Sub graph F is contained in G or G contains F.\n",
    "* Spanning sub-graph\n",
    "  * Spaning sub graph contains all vertices of original graph G.\n",
    "  * Hence spanning sub-graph can only be obtained by edge deletions.\n",
    "* A sub-graph obtained only by vertext deletion is called induced sub-graph.\n",
    "* Let G be a graph, and all vertices have deg>=2, then G containts a cycle.\n",
    "  * If G is not simple then either we have a loop or a parallel-edge.\n",
    "  * Now lets look at the above for a simple graph.\n",
    "    * Look at the longest Path P, $V_{1}....V_{k}$ now $V_{k}$ must connect back to a vertex in the given path for >=2 degree, hence a cycle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Problems?\n",
    "* graphs isomorphic or not?\n",
    "* 3-regular graph must have even order; sum(degree_all) = 2*|E|, hence num(ver) must be even for sum to be even.\n",
    "* for n>=4, for even even integer, there exist a 3-regular graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walk, Path, Trail\n",
    "* Walk : Sequence of vertices and edges; v0, e1, v1, e2, v2, e3 ....vk-1, ek, vk => Not necessarily distinct. V and E can repeat.\n",
    "  * If simple graph then just write vertices.\n",
    "  * |W| = |E| in walk\n",
    "* Trail : Walk such that all the edges are distinct.\n",
    "* Path : Walk such that all the vertices and edges are distinct; P: $[v1, v2, v0, v3]$\n",
    "* A walk is **closed** if the start and end vertices are identical (vo == vk)\n",
    "* If there is a walk/path from x to y, we can write it xy walk/path.\n",
    "  * x --k--> y == walk from x to y of length k\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance b/w Vertices and connceted components\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distance(u, v) = Length of shorted path b/w u and v; Any walk(and hence a path) from u to v in G.\n",
    "  * $d_{G}(u, v)$=min{k | u --k-->v}\n",
    "* What if we have disconneted graph?\n",
    "  * no path b/w vertex from disconnected components, hence distance = $\\infty$\n",
    "* A graph G is connected if $d_{G}(u, v) < \\infty$, $\\forall$ (u, v) $\\epsilon$ G, and disconnted otherwise.\n",
    "* The **maximal** connected sub-graph of G are its connected components, C(G) = #connected components of G.\n",
    "  * Maximality means that a sub-graph $H \\subseteq G$ is a connceted sub-graph and for any V not in H, if we add this to H then it'd become disconnted.\n",
    "* So a connected Graph has C(G) = 1 !\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corollaries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every xy-walk in G would contain a xy-path in G.\n",
    "  * If we remove repeated vertices then we'd have a path.\n",
    "    * ux...ui..uj...ui...uy ---> Remove the ui ---> ui walk and thus removing the repeated vertex.\n",
    "  * Basically remove the repeated edge(and hence $u_{i} \\rightarrow u_{i}$), repeat until all the repeated vertices are removed, and thus we'd get path.\n",
    "* G is bipartite iff it has no odd cycle.\n",
    "\n",
