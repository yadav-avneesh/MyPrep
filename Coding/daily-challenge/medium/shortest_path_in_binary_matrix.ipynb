    "Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.\n",

    "A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "All the visited cells of the path are 0.\n",
    "All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).\n",

    "\n",
    "(1)\n",
    "If an interviewer asks you this question in an interview, then their goal is probably to determine that:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can recognize that this is a typical shortest path problem that can be solved with a Breadth-first search (BFS). You can correctly implement a BFS to solve it. For bonus points, you know that the solution could be optimized using the A* algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph is almost always done using BFS, and all programmers should know this. BFS is one of the fundamental algorithms that you are expected to be confident coding before a tech interview. So, if you're finding this question challenging, then you're doing the right thing by working on it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Approach 1\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS + Overwrite grid value of visited to 1, to keep track of visited\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is nice in that it's very intuitiveâ€”it's directly based on how you might solve the problem on a whiteboard. It also avoids the need for a \"visited\" set or data structures to keep track of distances, thus saving a constant amount of memory over typical BFS implementations. However, like all in-place algorithms, overwriting the input can cause problems. Here are a couple of possible scenarios you need to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "That the algorithm is running in a * multithreaded* environment, and it does not have exclusive access to the grid. Other threads might need to read the grid too, and might not expect it to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "That there is only a single thread or the algorithm has exclusive access to the grid while running, but the grid might need to be reused later or by another thread once the lock has been released.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2.a) Solution to above,\n",
    "    a. overwrite with value 2, at the end, re-write grid to be 0 if 2, but can't protect against multi-threading !\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Approach 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What I did -- BFS + O(N) set for tracking visited\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Approach 3\n",
    "\n",
    "A* -- heuristic based search algo.\n",
    "    modify the algorithm to prioritize promising paths over not so promising paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To do this, we need to come up with a heuristic that, given a potential option, it measures how much \"promise\" that option has. Then we prioritize the options (exploring cells) with the highest \"promise\". In the previous approaches, we were actually doing this; our heuristic was simply distance traveled so far. But we can do better than that!\n",
