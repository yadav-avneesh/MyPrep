    "If you were asked this question in a real interview, you should expect to discuss real-world issues related to it. For example, it would not be realistic to store the data in volatile computer memory. In practice, computers fail (e.g. lose power) so we need to store the data in a permanent medium, such as a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we might need to consider scalability. In a large city, such as Tokyo, the metro system gets 7 million passenger trips per day! With a little math, we can quickly estimate that during peak travel time, there must be thousands of check-ins and check-outs every second. This is a lot of data that one computer would need to receive through its network connection! To make this work, we'd probably be using more than one computer. This introduces concurrency issues that would need to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also likely that this module would have to fit in with other code in the passenger-tracking system. It's not likely that a little average time tracker will get exclusive use of all resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your actual implementation, you'll probably be expected to use HashMaps. This is common in system design interview questions: you're given a complex real world problem to explore and then are asked to implement a small piece of it.\n",
