    "You are given an integer N. You have to find smallest \n",
    "multiple of N which consists of digits 0 and 1 only. \n",
    "Since this multiple could be large, return it in form of a string.\n",

    "Note:\n",
    "    Returned string should not contain leading zeroes. For example,\n",

    "* Of course we saw that we need to have a tree of 1-0 to define a number, \n",
    "  and we want smallest multiple so we go left 0 and right 1 while root \n",
    "  always starts at 1.\n",
    "* Then at each level we can do traversal and see if the multiple is found,\n",
    "  we can't compute multiple for large numbers so we can carry forward the \n",
    "  mod N value to the next node level\n",
    "* A hint was also to see if we can reduce the state by thinking of ith state\n",
    "  which gives mod i, and then going to i=0.\n",
