As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. -- James Allen

Mind is the master power that shapes and makes; And man is mind,

wills, Bring forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills; He thinks
in secret, and it comes to pass, Environment is but his looking-glass.

to go;

Do not know the how, know the what, and be open to discovering and
receiving -- the how;
