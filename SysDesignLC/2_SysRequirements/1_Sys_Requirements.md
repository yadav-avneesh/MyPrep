In this lesson we discuss
- What are functional and non-functional requirements.
- Why they are so important.

## Dialog-1

### Interviewer
- Let me state a vague and ambigous problem and see how the candidate approaches
  it.

### Interviewee
- The problem seems too big, I should try to define specific
  requirements - functions and reduce the scope.
- Also, I need to figure out Non-functional requirements and use my knowledge of
  systems design concepts, and patterns to address each requirement.
