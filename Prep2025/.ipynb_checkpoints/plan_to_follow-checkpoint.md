## Longer Preparation Plan (4–6 months)

if you're okay extending:
- Increase the depth of topics (e.g., explore Kubernetes, cloud services).
- Solve LeetCode problems at a slower pace (10/week instead of 20).
- Read more books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" and "Designing Distributed Systems".

Key Tools and Strategies
- Timeboxing: Focus on one task per session to avoid burnout.
- Tracking Progress: Use Trello or Notion to track topics and problems.
- Leverage Resources: Use Educative.io, Grokking System Design, and NeetCode playlists.

### Tips for Each Round
- Coding: Focus on clarity and communicating your thought process. Prioritize clean, modular code.
- LLD: Use UML diagrams to showcase relationships and justify design patterns used.
- HLD: Always discuss trade-offs (e.g., CAP theorem), scalability, and failure recovery.
- Behavioral: Structure answers using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Result(Impact) should be so that it should be at the level of the position you are interviewing for. For a sr staff impact should be higher level, not improving perf by 3x.
- Leadership: Show alignment with company principles and demonstrate strategic thinking. Same - thought/thinking to be shown at sr staff level
